# Yet another Brick-Game Racing Game
---
**Why:** I was bored at home & remembered how as i kid i enjoyed playing with my *Brick-Game 9999-in-1* console. 

So i figured it would be awesome to recreate one of the games i enjoyed from the console using Phaser-ce. :boom:

:smirk: This would also serve as a great learning experience for me.

Code might not be optimized... :trollface: 

# How to play?

Well, Clone this repo & open it with your local server. Phaser-ce requires server to run.
What i normally do is use the php build in server. You can do the same if u have php installed:
> Run this command: ``$ sudo php -S localhost:301`` on the root of the games directory
