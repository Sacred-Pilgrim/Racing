#Yet another Brick-Game Racing Game
---
**Why:** I was bored at home & remembered how as i kid i enjoyed playing with my *Brick-Game 9999-in-1* console. 

So i figured it would be awesome to recreate one of the games i enjoyed from the console using Phaser-ce. :boom:

:smirk: This would also serve as a great learning experience for me.
